# Learning PHP - My Notes

---

## Basic Language Syntax:

- PHP is often included directly in HTML files, and declared with a php tag like `<?php ...your code here ?>`
- Variables are declared like `?name = "David"` or `?age = 35`
- To print code -- to the terminal or to a webpage if included in an html tag -- use `echo`
