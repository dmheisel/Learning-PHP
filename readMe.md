# Learning PHP - My Notes

---

## Basic Language Syntax:

- PHP is often included directly in HTML files, and declared with a php tag like `<?php ...your code here ?>`
- Variables are declared like `?name = "David"` or `?age = 35`
- To print code -- to the terminal or to a webpage if included in an html tag -- use `echo`
- All lines should end in semicolon

## Arrays:

- arrays are declared similarly to variables: `$myArray = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`
- arrays are zero-indexed, so indices in array are accessed similarly to js: `echo $myArray[2]` will print 2.
